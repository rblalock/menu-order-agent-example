# 🤖 Restaurant Menu AI Agent

An intelligent AI agent that processes natural language orders for a restaurant menu system. This agent understands menu items, handles order customizations, and provides a conversational ordering experience.

## 🎯 Overview

The Restaurant Menu Agent is designed to:
- Process natural language ordering requests ("I want a large pizza with extra cheese")
- Understand the restaurant's menu structure and item details
- Handle customizations and special requests
- Ask for clarification when orders are ambiguous
- Provide order summaries and confirmations
- Stream responses in real-time for better user experience


## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

## 🚀 Quick Start
